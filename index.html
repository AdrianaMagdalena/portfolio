          <p>I am an aspiring FrontEnd Developer.</p>
          <p>
            I discovered my passion for Web Development in my late twenties and
            decided to go on a self-learning adventure. After 8 months of
            studying, I'm proud to say I've done it. I'm still learning and I
            don't expect to ever stop learning, but I'm ready to take on bigger
            challenge and work full-time as a FrontEnd Developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my projects I strive for clean, aesthetically pleasing and
            eye-catching design. I tend to never stop learning which helps me
            with bettering my knowledge and creating perfect websites.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Born in Poland, now living in Hungary.</p>
        <p>
          I get interested by a lot of things all the time. Apart from FrontEnd
          Development, nowadays I create pixel art, embroidery, I crochet and
          knit. As a graduate of Hungarian Studies, I'm also interested in
          translations of Hungarian literature, the modern Hungarian literature
          itself, and also linguistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Computer sciences interested me for a long time, I was always curious
          of inner workings of it. After working as IT service desk agent and
          then as manual tester of websites, it was just natural to try to
          understand how websites are created.
